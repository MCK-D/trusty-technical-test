# Exercise 4: Adding Unit Tests

## Objective
Evaluate the candidate's ability to write unit tests to ensure code quality.

## Instructions
- Implement unit tests for your API using **Jest** or any other testing framework.
- The tests should cover:
  - A valid request with an existing `companyName`.
  - A request with a non-existent `companyName`.
  - A request with valid filters (from Exercise 2).
  - A request with invalid filters.

## Input
- Test the API behavior with different datasets (mock data or direct calls to the external service).

## Expected Output
- A test report with successful assertions and a code coverage percentage.
