# Trusty's Backend Challenge: Node.js or TypeScript

First of all, **congratulations**! You've successfully navigated the initial steps of our recruitment process. ðŸŽ‰

In this challenge, you will develop an API using either **Node.js** or **TypeScript** to retrieve and organize data from an open-source database.

## Guidelines

- Clone this repository (**do not** fork it).
- Solve the exercises in **ascending order**.
- Make only **one commit per exercise**, and include the `.git` folder when submitting your test.
- You are free to choose between **Node.js** and **TypeScript** for this technical challenge.

An `expected_output.json` file is included to provide a reference for the desired results.

## Pointers

Trustyâ€™s technical challenge is designed to help you showcase your skills as a developer and give us an insight into your coding abilities within a specific stack. This exercise allows you significant flexibility in terms of structure, logic, and technical choices. Feel free to suggest additional features if you believe they would add value.

Our technical team will closely evaluate:

- The organization of your files.
- The quality of your code.
- Your approach to simplicity: **less is more**.
- Your technical decisions.
- Your ability to propose creative solutions: **thinking outside the box**.

Additionally:

- Running `$ npm run start` from the exercise folder should generate the desired output. However, feel free to add more files if necessary.

## Submitting Your Results

Once youâ€™ve completed the challenge, please send your results to **Trusty** at:

`maxime@hellotrusty.io`

You can either send a link to your project on GitHub/GitLab/... or zip your project directory and email it. If youâ€™re not using GitHub/GitLab/..., donâ€™t forget to include your `.git` folder.

Good luck, and we look forward to hearing from you!
